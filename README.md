# SatOrb: Satellite Orbit Simulator

SatOrb is a Python-based repository that allows you to simulate a satellite's Low Earth Orbit (LEO) trajectory and generate its ground track visualization. With a graphical user interface (GUI), you can input custom launch position and speed to visualize the satellite's orbit and track its path on a map projection.

## Features

- GUI interface for easy input of launch position and speed
- Simulation of satellite trajectory using numerical integration methods
- Generation of ground track visualization on a map projection

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/username/SatOrb.git

2. Install the required dependencies:

   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. Run the `satellite_gui.py` script to launch the GUI:

   python satellite_gui.py
```

2. Input the launch position and speed in the GUI fields.

3. Click the "Simulate" button to start the simulation.

4. The ground track visualization will be displayed, showing the satellite's path on the map projection.
